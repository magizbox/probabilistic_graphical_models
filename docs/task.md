## Phonological Analysis

Phonology is analysis of spoken language. Therefore, it deals with speech recognition and generation. The core task of speech recognition and generation system is to take an acoustic waveform as input and produce as output, a string of words. The phonology is a part of natural language analysis, which deals with it. The area of computational linguistics that deals with speech analysis is computational phonology

X means unknown but the world is pretty known it's seven billion people have seven stones. One billion can save money to fly abroad on holiday every year. One billion can save money to keep a car or buy a car. And then three billion they save money to pay the by be a bicycle or perhaps a two-wheeler. And two billion they are busy saving money to buy shoes. In the future they will get rich and these people we move over here, these people will move over here, we will have two billion more in the world like this and the question is whether the rich people over there are prepared to be integrated in the world with 10 bilions people.
