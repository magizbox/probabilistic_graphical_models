# Optical Word Recognition

We will be studying the computer vision task of recognizing words from images. The task of recognizing words is usually decomposed to recognition of individual characters from their respective images (optical character recognition, OCR), and hence inferring the word. However character recognition is often a very difficult task, and since each character is predicted independent of its neighbors, its results can often contain combinations of characters that may not be possible in English. In this homework we will augment a simple OCR model with additional factors that capture some intuitions based on character co-occurences and image similarities.

The undirected graphical model for recognition of a given word is given in the figure above. It consists of two types of variables:

Image Variables: These are observed images that we need to predict the corresponsing character of, and the number of these image variables for a word is the number of characters in the word. The value of these image variables is an observed image, represented by an integer id (less than 1000). For the description of the model, assume the id of the image at position i is represented by img(i).
Character Variables: These are unobserved variables that represent the character prediction for each of the images, and there is one of these for each of the image variables. For our dataset, the domain of these variables is restricted to the ten most frequent characters in the English language ({e,t,a,o,i,n,s,h,r,d} [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_English_language)), instead of the complete alphabet. For the discussion below, assume the predicted character at position i is represented by char(i).
